## Repository Structure

### Books/
Contains reference materials and historical texts related to the whaling industry.

### Code/
Contains all data processing and analysis scripts. The main files include:
- **clean.do**: Initial data cleaning and preparation script
- **IE[1-9].do/r**: Initial exploration files with descriptive statistics and various analyses
- **ML_estimation/**: Subfolder containing Maximum Likelihood estimation code for production models

A detailed README for the code structure is available within the Code folder.

### Data/
Stores all datasets used in the analysis:
- **masters.dta**: Captain (master) information
- **masters_voyages_merged.dta/csv**: Merged dataset combining captain and voyage information
- **temp\***: Any file starting with 'temp' is an intermediate file used only within a particular code file

### Figures/
Contains all visualizations generated by the analysis scripts, organized by meeting dates:
- **meeting_YYMMDD/**: Figures prepared for specific meeting presentations
- Figures are named with prefixes indicating their source file (e.g., `IE8_sim_coeff_time.png` is created by the `IE8.do` script)

### Writeup/
Documentation and analysis outputs:
- **Tables/**: Contains all statistical tables generated by the code
  - Tables follow the naming convention: `[SourceFile]_[description].tex`
  - Example: `IE7_experience_on_production.tex` is created by the IE7 script
- Additional documentation and analysis write-ups

## Output Naming Convention

All figures and tables are saved with a systematic naming convention:
- **Prefix**: Indicates the source code file (e.g., `IE6`, `IE8`, `M1`)
- **Suffix**: Describes the content of the figure or table
- **Format**: Figures are typically `.png`, tables are `.tex` for LaTeX integration

Examples:
- `IE6_weight_shipFE.png`: Weight vs Ship Fixed Effects plot from IE6
- `IE7do_tab1.tex`: Table 1 generated by IE7.do
- `M1_master_voyages.png`: Master voyages distribution from captain analysis
