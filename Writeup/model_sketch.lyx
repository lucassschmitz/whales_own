 can be thought as an exogenously determined random variable (the ship goes out and when it is full the ship returns) or as an optimal stopping problem (state vars are storage space and fish conditions:
 there are many or few whales)

- matching:
 ships are matched with captains.
 Captains have an underlying quality and 1.
 if there is evidence of learning one can introduce learning and 2.
 have a history that is used by ship owners to determine their quality.
 The demand for captains will depend on the number of ships.
 If demand decreases only the ‘best’ captains are matched.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Note that a ship is a multi-product firm.
 There are two modeling options 1.
 ratios are exogenously determined (e.g.
 every ship goes and gets some quantitiy of each prodcut) or 2.
 the ratio of outputs is endogenous (e.g.
 if bones are spetially expensive at some point then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Note that the sperm and whale oil price have an inverted u-shape.
 but the whalebones are increasing.
 Does the ratio of the different products change as a response to this change in the ratio of prices?

\begin_layout Standard
- Ship entry/exit:
 ships of a given size are produced given an expected path of prices,
 they depreciate over time and when the scrap value is higher than the present value of profits they are sold as scrap
